# Package Manager Fix Summary

## Problem

The project had conflicting package managers - it was configured to use pnpm but had a `package-lock.json` file from npm, causing dependency management confusion.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Conflicting Files

- ✅ Deleted `package-lock.json` from root directory
- ✅ This file was conflicting with `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### 2. Updated Configuration Files

#### `.gitignore`

- ✅ Added `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` to prevent future conflicts
- ✅ Ensures only `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed

#### `.npmrc`

- ✅ Created `.npmrc` with pnpm-specific configuration
- ✅ Added `auto-install-peers=true`, `shamefully-hoist=false`, `prefer-workspace-packages=true`, `save-workspace-protocol=true`
- ✅ Set `fund=false` and `strict-peer-dependencies=false` to reduce noise and ease local installs

#### `apps/frontend/package.json`

- ✅ Added missing `name` and `version` fields
- ✅ Now properly identified as `@focipedia/frontend`

### 3. Added Safety Measures

#### `scripts/check-package-manager.js`

- ✅ Created script to detect npm/yarn lock files
- ✅ Prevents accidental use of wrong package manager

#### `package.json`

- ✅ Added `preinstall` script to run package manager check in root and all workspaces
- ✅ Fails fast if npm or yarn is used (enforced via scripts/check-package-manager.js)
- ✅ Root package.json and each workspace now include `packageManager: "pnpm@9.0.0"` and `engines.pnpm`

### 4. Verified Installation

- ✅ Installed pnpm globally
- ✅ Ran `pnpm install` successfully
- ✅ Verified frontend builds with `pnpm --filter @focipedia/frontend build`

## Current State

- ✅ Project now uses pnpm exclusively
- ✅ All dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Workspace configuration working properly
- ✅ Safety measures in place to prevent future conflicts

## Usage

All package management should now use pnpm commands:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` - Install dependencies in CI-reproducible mode
- `pnpm dev` - Start development servers
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @focipedia/frontend build` - Build frontend only
- `pnpm --filter @focipedia/backend build` - Build backend only

## Notes

- Some peer dependency warnings about TypeScript version exist but don't affect functionality
- Windows symlink warnings during build are normal and don't impact the application
